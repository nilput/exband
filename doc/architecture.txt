In all modes we assume we have 1 server (For example listening on port 80)
Modes of operation:
    1 event loop, io done within the loop
    1 event loop, io done in separate threads
    multiple event loops and multiple threads, io done within the loops
    multiple processes, each 1 loop, io done within the loop


Vhosts, rules and sinks:
    domains are described in exb_http_domain_config structs in http config, each domain is associated with a set of rules
    rules like: an http path prefix to be mapped to a filesystem for example
    rules point to sinks, a sink can be a filesystem path, or a module (like a web app)
