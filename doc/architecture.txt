In all modes we assume we have 1 server (For example listening on port 80)
Modes of operation:
    "multithreading" (default):
        multiple threads and multiple event loops, io done within the loops.
    "multiprocessing":
        multiple processes, each having 1 event loop, io done within the loop.


Vhosts, rules and sinks:
    domains are described in exb_http_domain_config structs in http config, each domain is associated with a set of rules
    rules like: an http path prefix to be mapped to a filesystem for example
    rules point to sinks, a sink can be a filesystem path, or a module (like a web app)
