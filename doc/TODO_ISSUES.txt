This file is for listing bugs in the codebase, including ones not discovered yet

* Hypothetical bugs:
    *For functions that take ownership of arguments, stick to one convention for dealing with
      errors, there are two choices:
        1- destroy the arguments in all cases, even in the case of an error
        2- never destroy the arguments in case of errors, and make that the responsibility of the caller
        example for #1:
            int save_str_in_config(char *mallocd_str) {
                int rv = try_to_save(mallocd_str);
                if (rv != 0) {
                    free(mallocd_str);
                }
                return rv;
            }
      Solution:
        enforce one way of doing this, by checking all code
        if functions need a different way, then they should be named to indicate that
