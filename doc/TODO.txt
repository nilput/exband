DO A performance testing setup, that targets   \
   the event loop and the threadpool, (without \
   actual http/io events, just measuring how   \
   fast the communication/parsing is)          [ ]

Ensure compatibility with 32bit systems        \

Increase buffer size integers to a larger      \
type such as size_t, and check for             \
overflow conditions                            [ ]

 have an option of running multiple eloops,    \  
 each having its own epoll listener and doing  \
 io directly instead of having to communicate  \
 with other threads                            [x]

dont add epollout for socket immediately, only \
 do that if writing proves to be a problem for \
 a particular socket                           [ ]
